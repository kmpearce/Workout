# Workout

Customizable bodyweight circuit workout! The full body set alternates cardio and strength exercises and on/off time and number of rounds can be set by the user. The core routine at the end functions similarly.

The current version has a ding sound to start the exercise, a click sound halfway through, and a bell to mark the end of the exercise.

In order to have the code run and for these sounds to play, you must have the corresponding mp3 files in the directory. 

Feel free to switch it up with different exercises in the exercise lists as well as different sounds/timing. Have a great workout!
